synchronize(): I detected 229 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 985

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 966 of 981 EEG events (98.5%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
