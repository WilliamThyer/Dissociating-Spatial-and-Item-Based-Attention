-- 543460 EEG samples in synchronization range
-- 909827 ET samples in synchronization range
-- 500.00 Hz EEG sampling rate
-- 837.07 Hz estimated ET sampling rate [*]
   ([*] taking EEG as master clock & assuming the ET recording was never paused)
-- Eye track will be downsampled to match the EEG sampling rate

-- Note: the toolbox does not yet implement a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.


synchronize(): I detected 199 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 982

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:
