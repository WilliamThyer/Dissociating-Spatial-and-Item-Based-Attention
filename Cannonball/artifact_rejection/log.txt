synchronize(): I detected 1283 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 6108

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 1031 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 4986

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Warning: For 1 of 6173 EEG events (0.0%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 969 of 4501 EEG events (21.5%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.

synchronize(): I detected 1343 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 17

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 6669 of 6686 EEG events (99.7%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 17 events, it is distributed as follows:

Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 6628

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Error [smp]	Events
-------------------------
          -4           0
          -3           0
          -2           4
          -1         675
           0        5459
           1         490
           2           0
           3           0
           4           0

-------------------------
Mean abs. sync. error (estimated from "shared" events): 0.354 ms
